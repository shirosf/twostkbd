* Two stroke single hand keyboard
** Introduction
This a following project to [[https://github.com/shirosf/binarykbd][Binary5 keyboard]]
The basic idea of this keyboard is as follows:
+ hit one of 6 keys twice: 36 codes
+ 4 modifiers: 'shift','ctrl','alt', and one more 'ext'
+ 4 function keys: 'TAB','SPACE','BACK SPACE','RETERN'

The total uses 14 keys.
26 of the 36 codes are used for alphabet character codes.
The other 10 are used for numerical character codes.
'ext' modifiers support symbol character codes.

** Hardware
KiCAD schematic and PCB data are in 'pcb' directory.
The HW consists of key switches, LEDs and Raspberry Pi Zero.
The circuits are mostly simple conections between GPIOs and switches.
